# Medidata's Jive Repo

This repo is a collection of Integrations, projects and custom code to work with [JiveSoftware](https://www.jivesoftware.com/).  The code here was originally designed to meet business use cases for [Medidata](https://www.mdsol.com/)'s collaborative Intranet, but has been made public according to license indicated in each project folder.  We welcome collaboration on improving our Jive community integrations and custom code to further provide value to our business users.  Any questions about this repo should be addressed to [Nik Edmiidz on the JC](https://community.jivesoftware.com/people/edmiidz) or express@mdsol.com.
