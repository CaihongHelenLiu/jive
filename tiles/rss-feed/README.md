## RSS Feed Tile

This tile requires a middleware server running on a separate server. Before
installing this tile, make sure to set up a server using the Node.js script
in the `rss-server` folder. Then, make sure to point the tile to the URL or
IP address of the server in `server-info-example.js`, which must be renamed
to server-info.js.
