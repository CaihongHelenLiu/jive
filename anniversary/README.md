# Jive Anniversary

Jive Anniversary posts a status update to a specific group when a user has a work anniversary as indicated by the "Hire Date" field in their user profile. It can also post status updates at regional appropriate timezones if a "Region" field is set appropriately.
For example, if script is having a variable set, it will post updates for users from that timezone:
```
 $ node index.js "North America"
```
or
```
 $ node index.js APAC
```

For a corporate intranet, you can have it only run for active full-time employees, by filtering on "Employee Type" and "Employee Status" fields.

The status message will look something like:
````

*Posted by UserBotâ€‹*
````
