# Jive Anniversary

Jive Anniversary posts a status update to a specific group when a user has a work anniversary as indicated by the "Hire Date" field in their user profile. It can also post status updates at regional appropriate timezones if a "Region" field is set appropriately.
For example, if cron jobs are set up accordingly:
 - at 0:00 UTC it will run for APAC users
 - at 8:00 UTC it will run for EMEA users
 - at 14:00 UTC it will run for all other users

For a corporate intranet, you can have it only run for active full-time employees, by filtering on "Employee Type" and "Employee Status" fields.

The status message will look something like:
````
